# Sales Prediction Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts product sales based on advertising expenditures across different media channels using **Linear Regression**.

The objective is to analyze how advertising budgets influence sales and build a machine learning model capable of forecasting future sales.

This project was completed as part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains advertising budgets spent on:

* TV
* Radio
* Newspaper

Target Variable:

* Sales

### Dataset Features

| Feature   | Description                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| TV        | Advertising budget spent on TV        |
| Radio     | Advertising budget spent on Radio     |
| Newspaper | Advertising budget spent on Newspaper |
| Sales     | Product sales                         |

Dataset Size:

* Rows: 200
* Columns: 4

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

* Dataset inspection
* Missing value analysis
* Statistical summary
* Correlation analysis
* Correlation heatmap
* Scatter plots for:

  * TV vs Sales
  * Radio vs Sales
  * Newspaper vs Sales

### Key Findings

## 📊 Model Performance

### R² Score

```text
0.9059
```

The model explains approximately **90.59%** of the variance in sales, indicating excellent predictive performance.

### Feature Coefficients

| Feature   | Coefficient |
| --------- | ----------- |
| TV        | 0.0545      |
| Radio     | 0.1009      |
| Newspaper | 0.0043      |

### Interpretation

* Increasing TV advertising budget increases sales.
* Increasing Radio advertising budget increases sales.
* Newspaper advertising has very little impact on sales.
