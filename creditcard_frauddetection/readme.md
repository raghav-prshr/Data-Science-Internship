# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A Machine Learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions using the Random Forest Classifier.

The project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, class balancing using SMOTE, model training, and evaluation using various performance metrics and visualizations.

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud has become one of the major financial security challenges. Since fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to genuine transactions, this project uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset before training a Random Forest classifier.

The trained model achieves high accuracy while maintaining good precision and recall for fraud detection.
